            <h3>Story of Jacob Zheng</h3>
            <p>Many high school students, especially Asian American students, are feeling intense pressure to gain admission to a prestigious college. Since Asian culture is heavily tied to success in academics, his Asian American friends and him have been anxious over seeing the lowered admission rates for top colleges. To make matters worse, Asian American students are often told by their parents that they are failures for not getting into Harvard, Stanford, UCLA — the list goes on.</p>
