            <h3>Story of John Ridlehoover</h3>
            <p>This is a personal story by John Ridlehoover. Ridlehoover has been a professional writer for 10 years and has been writing for 20 years. He’s half Filipino and grew up in a small Southern town. He was the only Asian kid in every school he attended before high school. He said that “I didn’t notice until another kid pointed it out to me. Then it was all I could see.”</p>
            <p>Kids in his school asked him questions like if he ate cats or dogs or made fun of the way his food smelled. Then he began to isolate himself from the community so that he could blend into the background. Ridlehoover first began to feel depressed in middle school. He said “[e]verything I used to love seemed less interesting. It was like the world had lost all its color, and I was the only one who’d noticed.” To him, days passed dull and boring. He wanted to control his feelings. He didn’t want to feel sad and depressed all the time. He eventually found a solution to make those bad feelings go away: drugs.</p>
            <p>Ridlehoover started to use drugs and alcohol to numb his feelings. This self-medicating worked until the drugs triggered his anxiety. It wasn’t long after that he experienced the worst depressive episode of his life. Simply “getting through” every day felt like a challenge. Nothing he used to love made him feel better, and he felt like he was becoming a burden to his friends and family. One night, he considered ending his life. He considered it for a long time. He ended up calling his girlfriend, now his wife, and she suggested him to go see a therapist. With the help of his therapist, Ridlehoover realized that “no one can ‘fix [him]’, [he’s the only one that can find the right coping mechanisms”.</p>
            <p>Ridlehoover saids “I’ve learned that when it comes to the Asian-American experience with mental illness, our stories our similar, but never exactly the same. I’ve met members of our community who said their family told them to hide their mental illness as it could keep them from getting a good job. My family may not have understood what I was going though at first, but they’ve always been supportive of me seeking out help.”</p>

            <h3>Story of Jacob Zheng</h3>
            <p>This is a story shared by Jacob Zheng about the mental situation of Asian students who are uprising to college. Many high school students, especially Asian American students, are feeling intense pressure to gain admission to a prestigious college. Since Asian culture is heavily tied to success in academics, his Asian American friends and him have been anxious over seeing the lowered admission rates for top colleges. To make matters worse, Asian American students are often told by their parents that they are failures for not getting into Harvard, Stanford, UCLA — the list goes on.</p>
            <p>The subject of mental health is not widely discussed within Asian American communities. It is still considered “taboo,” especially to Asians from the older, immigrant generations. Zheng shares that, according to the American Psychological Association, Asian culture, or more specifically Asian immigrant culture, is centered around hard work, efficiency, and being the best. This competitive environment causes many young Asian Americans to push themselves to their limits, constantly compromising their mental health and wellbeing.</p>
            <p>As an Asian American student himself, he understand this culture of competition and excellence too well. He have heard many traditionally minded Asian parents chalk psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, to “laziness and excuses.” The lack of education and understanding on topics surrounding mental health and wellbeing fails to provide young Asian Americans with a platform to seek professional help.</p>
            <p>Asian American students who are perceived as “model children” force themselves to take 6 or more AP courses in one semester. But the inability to do well in these courses further degrades their mental illness. Without resources or support, many of these Asian American students are left to suffer privately. This feeling of isolation also leads to other more serious issues such as suicide. According to the American Psychological Association, based on national suicide rates in 2007, suicide was the second leading cause of death for Asian Americans ages 15 through 34.</p>
            <p>Zheng concludes that “it is time that we educate both parents and children of the mental health resources available. We need to open up the discussion of mental health in our Asian American communities, for facilitating such discussions is the only way we can help the many students who are silently suffering.”</p>
